# Helix-Case

This repository contains a case I created for the 5 row version of the [helix keyboard](https://github.com/MakotoKurauchi/helix) by MakotoKurauchi.
I also included a pencil rail model that turns the keyboard to a 4 row version by sacrificing the number row.

The model included is the left side of the keyboard, for the right side you need to print the mirror model
